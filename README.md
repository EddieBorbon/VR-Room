# VR Room Project 🌟🕶️

## 🎨 Project Overview

In this project, I applied my skills from the VR Development pathway to create an immersive virtual reality (VR) room. This project showcases my understanding of key VR concepts, including interaction, locomotion, and spatial design within a VR environment using Unity.

## 🚀 What I Learned

### Beginner VR Development 🛠️

**Setting Up a VR Project:**
- Configured a Unity project for VR, including setting up the necessary software and configuring the VR headset.
- Implemented basic VR locomotion, allowing users to navigate the VR space using teleportation.

**Creating Interactive Elements:**
- Developed grabbable objects that users can pick up and interact with.
- Implemented sockets for objects to snap into place, enhancing the interactive experience.

**Understanding VR Hardware:**
- Gained insights into different VR headsets and their capabilities, helping to target the appropriate hardware for my project.

### Intermediate VR Design 🖼️

**Implementing Advanced Interactions:**
- Integrated audio and haptic feedback to increase immersion, making interactions feel more realistic.
- Configured activation events for objects, allowing users to trigger specific actions (e.g., turning on a TV with a remote).

**User Interface in VR:**
- Designed and implemented a world space user interface to provide users with instructions and a reset menu.

### Ergonomics and Optimization ⚙️

**Ensuring Comfort and Performance:**
- Applied techniques to reduce simulator sickness and improve accessibility, making the VR experience more comfortable for users.
- Optimized performance by managing key metrics such as frame rate and polycount to ensure smooth operation within the VR environment.
